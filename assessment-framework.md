# Assessment Framework - Fast Track Academy

## Philosophy of Assessment

Fast Track Academy uses **competency-based assessment** rather than traditional grades. You advance by demonstrating mastery through real-world projects and peer validation.

### Core Principles
- **Evidence-Based**: Show your learning through concrete deliverables
- **Self-Assessment**: Develop metacognitive skills by evaluating your own progress
- **Peer Review**: Learn from others and contribute to their growth
- **Iterative Improvement**: Assessment drives continuous learning, not just evaluation
