# Troubleshooting Guide - Fast Track Academy

## üöÄ Quick Problem Solvers

### "I'm overwhelmed and don't know where to start!"

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Take a deep breath - this is completely normal
2. Go to the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started-guide.md) and do ONLY the first 15 minutes
3. Choose the easiest possible first project from your preferred module
4. Set a timer for 30 minutes and just start something

**Why this happens:** Information overload is common in self-directed learning
**Prevention:** Focus on one small step at a time, ignore everything else initially

---

### "I started a project but I'm stuck and frustrated!"

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Document exactly where you're stuck (write it down)
2. Take a 15-30 minute break doing something physical
3. Search for your specific error message or problem online
4. Ask for help in the community with your specific issue

**Common Causes:**
- Skipped foundational steps
- Trying to do too much at once
- Missing dependencies or setup requirements
- Following outdated tutorials

**Solutions:**
- Go back to basics - verify your setup
- Break the problem into smaller pieces
- Find more recent tutorials on the same topic
- Ask someone else to look at your code/setup

---

### "I'm not learning fast enough!"

**Reality Check:**
- Real learning takes time - there are no shortcuts to mastery
- Comparing yourself to others is counterproductive
- Consistency beats intensity every time

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Review your daily learning log - you're probably learning more than you think
2. Celebrate small wins - document 3 things you learned this week
3. Adjust expectations - focus on progress, not perfection
4. Connect with others at your level for mutual support

## üß† Learning and Motivation Issues

### "I can't stay motivated to continue"

**Understanding Motivation Cycles:**
- Motivation naturally fluctuates - this is normal
- Discipline and systems matter more than motivation
- Small, consistent actions beat sporadic intense efforts

**Motivation Recovery Plan:**

**Week 1: Reset and Reconnect**
- Review your original goals and why you started
- Share your progress with someone supportive
- Celebrate what you've already accomplished
- Set one tiny goal for this week

**Week 2: Build Momentum**
- Focus on 15-minute learning sessions
- Connect with the community
- Help someone else with their project
- Track your progress visually

**Week 3: Increase Engagement**
- Join a study group or find an accountability partner
- Start a new, exciting mini-project
- Teach someone else what you've learned
- Reward yourself for consistency

### "I learn better in traditional classes"

**Adapting to Self-Directed Learning:**

**Structure Yourself:**
- Set specific study times like class schedules
- Create deadlines and stick to them
- Find or create study groups
- Use video tutorials as "lectures"

**Get External Accountability:**
- Find a mentor or learning buddy
- Join online study groups
- Share your goals publicly
- Schedule regular check-ins with someone

**Create Interactive Elements:**
- Take notes actively while learning
- Pause videos to practice concepts immediately
- Discuss what you're learning with others
- Create your own quiz questions

### "I feel like an imposter"

**Imposter Syndrome is Normal:**
- Every expert was once a beginner
- Making mistakes is part of learning
- You don't have to know everything to share your knowledge

**Combat Strategies:**
1. **Document Your Progress:**
   - Keep a learning journal
   - Screenshot your projects at different stages
   - Write about problems you've solved

2. **Help Others:**
   - Answer questions from people one step behind you
   - Create tutorials about what you just learned
   - Mentor someone starting their first project

3. **Reframe Your Thinking:**
   - "I don't know how to do this yet"
   - "I'm learning and improving"
   - "Making mistakes helps me understand better"

## üíª Platform-Specific Issues

### GitHub Issues

#### "I can't push my code to GitHub"

**Authentication Issues:**
```bash
# If you're getting authentication errors
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# For HTTPS repos, you might need a personal access token
# Generate one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

#### "I messed up my Git history"

**Don't Panic - Common Fixes:**
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (lose changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# If you pushed already and need to force update
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### API Issues

#### "I'm getting API rate limit errors"

**Immediate Solutions:**
1. **Check Your Usage:**
   - Review your API call frequency
   - Implement caching to reduce calls
   - Add delays between requests

2. **Request Limit Increases:**
   - Contact the API provider
   - Explain your use case
   - Consider paid tiers if needed

3. **Optimize Your Code:**
```python
import time

# Add delays between API calls
time.sleep(1)  # Wait 1 second between calls

# Cache responses to avoid duplicate calls
cache = {}
def get_api_data(query):
    if query in cache:
        return cache[query]
    # Make API call...
    cache[query] = result
    return result
```
